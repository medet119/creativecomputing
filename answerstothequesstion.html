	<ol>
	

	<li>  I think Amateur Web developers wanted to create a Web that would be attractive and fascinating to people. 
	So people wont be bored and stay longer on the web. They also wanted to give that dream
	to people with a help of different wallpapers and animations on the page.</li>
	

	<li>  I think trends of 2018 in Web Design that I saw very often on Android, Microsoft and Apple commercials 
	might be: shadow drop and depth. Its not new but with todays high techs and intense resolution, it gives lots
	of attractiveness to people. Shadowplay creates a surprisingly versatile effect that increases not only the aesthetics 
	of a web page, but also helps User Experience by providing emphasis. 
	 </li>
	

	<li>Another trend might be Particle background that is a great solution to performance issues websites run into with 
	a video background. Image says more than thousand words, and a moving one certainly does. Similarly, particle backgrounds
	immediately attract the users attention, so brands can create a memorable impression of themselves in only a few seconds. 
	Additionally, motion graphics like these are becoming more and more popular on social media, providing eye-popping leads back
	to landing pages.
	

	In essence, web design refers to both the aesthetic portion of the website and its usability. Web designers use various
	design programs such as Adobe Photoshop to create the layout and other visual elements of the website. Web Developers on the 
	other hand, take a website design and actually make a functioning website from it. Web developers use HTML, CSS, Javascript,
	PHP and other programming languages to bring to life the design files. </li>
